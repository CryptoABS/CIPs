What is an CIP?
--------------

CIP stands for CryptoABS Improvement Proposal. An CIP is a design document providing information to the CryptoABS, or describing a new feature for CryptoABS or its processes or environment. The CIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

CIP Formats and Templates
-------------------------

CIPs should be written in [markdown] format. Image files should be included in a subdirectory for that CIP.

CIP Header Preamble
-------------------

Each CIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

` CIP: ` <CIP number> (this is determined by the EIP editor)

` Title: `<CIP title>

` Status: `<Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected | Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>

` Author: `<list of author's real names and optionally, email address>

` Created: `<date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
